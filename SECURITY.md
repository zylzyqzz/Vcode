# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Vcode security fixes are prioritized for the currently developed Go rewrite
and the current 1.x release line.

| Version or branch | Security support |
| --- | --- |
| `main-v2` / 1.x releases | Supported |
| `v1` / 0.x legacy branch | Critical fixes only, where practical |
| Older releases, forks, or modified builds | Not covered unless the issue is reproducible upstream |

If you are unsure whether a version is affected, report against the newest
released 1.x version and include the exact version or commit you tested.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately. Do not open a public issue with exploit
details, secrets, crash dumps, or proof-of-concept payloads.

Preferred reporting path:

1. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting for this repository, if available.
2. If private reporting is not available to you, open a minimal public issue
   asking for a private maintainer contact path. Do not include exploit details
   in that issue.

Please include:

- Affected Vcode version, commit, operating system, and installation method.
- The feature or surface involved, such as CLI, desktop app, HTTP `serve`, bot
  gateway, MCP plugin, built-in tool, updater, or configuration loading.
- Clear reproduction steps using dummy credentials and non-sensitive files.
- The expected impact, such as secret disclosure, arbitrary file access,
  command execution, sandbox escape, authentication bypass, or supply-chain risk.
- Any relevant logs with API keys, tokens, local paths, and personal data
  redacted.

Do not send real provider API keys, bot credentials, OAuth tokens, private
workspace files, or third-party user data.

## Security Boundaries

Vcode is a local coding agent. Many features intentionally operate on the
user's local machine and workspace, including file reads, file writes, shell
commands, MCP plugins, language servers, bot sessions, and model-provider
requests. A finding is security-relevant when it crosses a supported boundary or
bypasses an explicit guard.

Supported boundaries include:

- Workspace confinement for file operations that are documented or implemented
  as workspace-scoped.
- Permission checks for tool calls, shell commands, file writes, and approvals.
- Sandbox behavior for built-in shell execution where the platform supports it.
- Secret handling for provider keys, bot credentials, OAuth tokens, plugin
  headers, and credential-store fallback files.
- HTTP `serve` protections for the unauthenticated local server, including
  localhost binding assumptions, JSON-only state-changing requests, and CORS
  restrictions.
- Desktop and bot session isolation, including per-workspace session metadata
  and configured bot allowlists.
- Updater, install, and release verification paths.

The following are normally treated as trusted local/operator-controlled inputs
unless another bug lets an untrusted actor supply them:

- CLI arguments and text typed directly by the local user.
- Project configuration files intentionally loaded from the current workspace.
- Explicit `@path` references supplied by the local user to attach local files.
- MCP servers, language servers, hooks, and slash commands installed or enabled
  by the local user.
- Provider base URLs and model names configured by the local user.

The following can be security issues when reachable by an untrusted actor or
when they bypass the intended boundary:

- Reading or writing files outside the configured workspace without explicit
  local-user intent.
- Following symlinks or path traversal to escape workspace confinement.
- Running shell commands or external tools without the required permission gate.
- Leaking credentials, environment variables, prompt history, local files, or bot
  messages to logs, model providers, MCP servers, crash reports, or telemetry.
- Allowing a website to drive the local HTTP server through CSRF, CORS, or
  content-type bypasses.
- Letting a bot user outside the configured allowlist submit prompts, approve
  tools, or access a project workspace.
- Trusting unverified update artifacts, plugin definitions, or downloaded
  binaries.

## `@` File References

Vcode supports `@path` references so users can include local files and images
in a prompt. This is intentional local functionality, but implementations must
preserve these invariants:

- In workspace-scoped sessions, relative and absolute paths must resolve under
  the active workspace root before file content is read or attached.
- Path traversal such as `..` must not escape the workspace root.
- Symlinks must not be usable to bypass the intended workspace boundary.
- Unscoped local CLI compatibility must not be exposed to remote, bot, or
  browser-controlled inputs unless an equivalent workspace boundary is applied.
- File content should be size-limited and binary content should not be dumped as
  prompt text.

Static analysis alerts about path expressions should be triaged against these
rules: user-controlled path data is expected, but the access must either stay
inside the configured workspace or be clearly limited to trusted local CLI use.

## Out of Scope

The following reports are usually out of scope unless they demonstrate a bypass
of one of the boundaries above:

- A local user intentionally asks Vcode to read, edit, or send their own
  files to a configured model provider.
- A local user installs or enables a malicious MCP server, hook, slash command,
  language server, or shell command and then grants it permission.
- A configured model provider, proxy, or MCP server receives data the user
  intentionally sent to it.
- Denial-of-service issues that only affect the local user's own session and do
  not corrupt files, leak secrets, or bypass permissions.
- Issues requiring administrator/root access on the user's machine before
  interacting with Vcode.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party services, models, proxies, or plugins that are
  not caused by Vcode behavior.

## Coordinated Disclosure

This is a community-maintained project. Maintainers will make a best-effort
assessment, ask follow-up questions when needed, and coordinate fixes before
public disclosure for confirmed vulnerabilities.

Please give maintainers reasonable time to investigate and release a fix before
publishing exploit details. If you plan to disclose on a timeline, include that
timeline in your initial report.
