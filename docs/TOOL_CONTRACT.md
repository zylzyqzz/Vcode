# Tool Contract

<a href="./TOOL_CONTRACT.zh-CN.md">简体中文</a>

This document records the provider-visible contract for Vcode compile-time built-in tools. It is generated from the same canonical schema path used by the runtime registry.

| Tool | Read-only | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bash` | false | Execute a command in the shell and return combined stdout/stderr. Use for builds, tests, git, package managers, etc. To search/read/list/edit/move files, prefer the dedicated tools (grep, read_file, ls, glob, edit_file, move_file) over shell grep/cat/ls/find/sed/mv/Move-Item - they behave identically on every OS. For symbol search or architecture questions, prefer LSP/read tools and targeted grep before shell commands. |
| `bash_output` | true | Read new output from a background job started with bash(run_in_background=true) or task(run_in_background=true). Returns the output produced since the last bash_output call for that job, plus its status (running/done/failed/killed). Does not block. |
| `code_index` | true | Lightweight built-in code symbol index. Prefer lsp_* for language semantics and installed code graph MCP tools for call graph, impact, and architecture relationships; use this as the local fallback for file outlines and symbol definition candidates, then verify with read_file or grep. |
| `complete_step` | true | Record the evidence-backed completion of ONE step of an approved plan. Call it as you finish each step instead of silently moving on: it signs the step off with PROOF it is done - the verification you ran (command + result), the diff/files you changed, or a manual check. A completion with no evidence is REJECTED, so don't claim a step is done until you can show why. The host advances the task list for you when you sign off - it marks this step completed and moves the next to in_progress, so you don't need a separate todo_write to mark completions. Fields: `step` (which step - its title or number, matching the task list), `result` (what is now true/changed), `evidence` (>=1 item, each with `kind` = verification\|diff\|files\|manual and a `summary`, plus optional `command`/`paths`), and optional `notes`. |
| `delete_range` | false | Delete a contiguous text range from a file using exact start/end text anchors. Each anchor must match exactly one line. Returns unified diff on success. Use for large deletions - smaller changes should use edit_file. |
| `delete_symbol` | false | Delete a named symbol (function, method, type, interface, const, var) from a Go source file using AST parsing. For non-Go files, use delete_range with manual anchors. |
| `edit_file` | false | Replace an exact string in a file with another. old_string must occur exactly once; add surrounding context to disambiguate. Use for targeted edits instead of rewriting the whole file. |
| `glob` | true | Find files matching a glob pattern (e.g. "*.go", "internal/*/*.go", "**/*.test.ts"). Supports shell metacharacters * ? [] and the recursive ** pattern. |
| `grep` | true | Search for a regular expression in a file, or recursively under a directory (skips hidden files and files matched by .gitignore). Returns matching lines as path:line:text, capped at 200 matches. |
| `kill_shell` | false | Terminate a running background job (bash or task) started with run_in_background. A no-op if the job has already finished or the id is unknown. |
| `ls` | true | List the entries of a directory. Directories are shown with a trailing slash; files show their byte size. Set recursive=true to list all nested files depth-first (skips .git/node_modules). |
| `move_file` | false | Move or rename a file from source_path to destination_path. Creates the destination parent directory as needed. Use instead of shell mv, Move-Item, or ren for file moves so workspace confinement and file-edit permissions apply. |
| `multi_edit` | false | Apply a list of edits to a single file atomically: each edit runs against the result of the previous one, all in memory; the file is rewritten only if every edit succeeds. Cheaper and safer than chaining edit_file calls - a failure in step 3 leaves the file untouched instead of half-edited. |
| `notebook_edit` | false | Edit one cell of a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb). Target a cell by 0-based cell_number (or cell_id). edit_mode: "replace" (default) swaps the cell's source; "insert" adds a new cell after cell_number (use -1 to prepend at the top), taking cell_type and new_source; "delete" removes the cell. cell_type is "code" or "markdown" (required for insert). Editing a code cell clears its outputs. Prefer this over edit_file for notebooks - it keeps the JSON valid. |
| `read_file` | true | Read a text file with optional line offset/limit. Output prefixes each line with its 1-based number so subsequent edit_file calls can target exact lines. Use `offset` and `limit` to page through large files; the tool reports total length and pagination hints in a trailer. |
| `todo_write` | true | Record and update a structured task list for the current work. Send the COMPLETE list every call - it replaces the previous one. Use it to plan multi-step work and show progress: keep exactly one item in_progress at a time, and flip an item to completed the moment it's done (don't batch completions). Skip it for trivial single-step tasks. |
| `wait` | true | Block until background jobs finish, then return each job's status and final output/answer. Use to collect the result of a task(run_in_background) or bash(run_in_background) before continuing. Omit job_ids to wait for every running job. |
| `web_fetch` | true | Fetch a URL over HTTPS/HTTP and return its text content. HTML pages are reduced to readable text; JSON / plain text / markdown bodies come back verbatim. Use to read documentation pages, API responses, or source files hosted somewhere the local filesystem can't reach. |
| `write_file` | false | Write content to a file at the given path (overwriting existing content). Creates parent directories as needed. |

## Schema Snapshot

The exact canonical schemas are intentionally tested in code rather than copied by hand here. Run:

```bash
go test ./internal/tool -run TestBuiltinToolContractDocumentation
```

The test checks that every registered built-in tool has a documented name, read-only flag, description row, and canonical schema generated by `tool.BuiltinContractEntries`.

## Default Full Boot Surface

In a default full-token boot, Vcode sends the built-in tools above plus the
session, memory, skill, subagent, LSP, install, and slash-command tools below:

`ask`, `explore`, `forget`, `history`, `install_skill`, `install_source`,
`list_sessions`, `lsp_definition`, `lsp_diagnostics`, `lsp_hover`,
`lsp_references`, `memory`, `parallel_tasks`, `read_only_skill`,
`read_only_task`, `read_session`, `read_skill`, `remember`, `research`,
`review`, `run_skill`, `security_review`, `slash_command`, `task`.

`internal/boot.TestBootToolContractMatchesProviderVisibleSurface` verifies the
actual boot registry contract against the provider request, including read-only
flags and canonical schemas.

## Token Economy Boot Surface

In token economy mode, Vcode starts with the core coding/session/memory tools
and the connector used to enable optional sources on demand:

`ask`, `connect_tool_source`, `forget`, `history`, `list_sessions`, `memory`,
`read_session`, `remember`, `slash_command`.

Core built-in tools such as `bash`, `read_file`, `grep`, file writers, job tools,
and `todo_write` remain available in economy mode and are listed in the built-in
table above.
